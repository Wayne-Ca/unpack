# unpack
 application to retrieve source code from a Basic09 I-Code module

This is currently the application decode. It only works on a single module. The future application unpack will allow processing of merged-module files. Until then you will have to use a modbuster application to separate the modules into separate files for use with decode.

Watch this space as I will be publishing more data and information about decode and it's outstanding issue with record (complex type) statements.
